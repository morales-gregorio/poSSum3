# The set of sequential alignment below demonstrated the variety of output
# volume options (options specific to sequential alignment, the examples do not
# cover common output volume options like spacing, origin, orientation,
# permutation and flipping. Again: these are not covered here. Check other
# examples for examples using common output volume options.

# So what options are covered here?  Well, some specific options related to
# postprocessing images after reslicing but before stacking as well as some
# options applied during stacking but, as mentioned none of the common output
# postprocessing options.

# This tutorial goes as follows.
#   1) We will conduct a single reconstruction and store the
#      produced transformations in a directory (a fairly advanced feature).
#      Because of that, it will be possible to produce the output stack using
#      various postprocessing options (another advanced applications) without
#      actual need of redoing the registration every time (definitely something
#      advancedi).
#   2) We will produce a numerous output volumes using some advanced
#      postprocessing options. I will try to descripe why and where individual
#      options may come in handy.

# Define the output transformations directory:
DIR_OUTPUT_TRANSFORMATIONS=10_sequential_alignment_transformations
mkdir -p ${DIR_OUTPUT_TRANSFORMATIONS}

# Step one:
# Calculating transformations without generating the output volume(s). 
# What is gonna happen here is that we will run the registration and store the
# produced volume but, in this run either reslicing of the images nor producing
# ouput volumes will be conducted. This will come later on

# To disable the application of the caluclated transformations to the images
# based on which the transformations have been calculated use the
# `--disable-reslice` switch. To prevent the output volumes from being
# generated, use `--disable-output-volumes` switch. Note that the
# `--disable-output-volumes` parameter does not automatically invoked the
# `--disable-reslice` switch. Have in mind that you cannot generate output
# volumes if the images have not been resliced.

# Here we crop the reconstructed stack of images fter they have been resliced.
# This is done by issuing the `--output-volume-roi` switch. First, you provide
# the origin of the region to crop (ox oy) and then the size of the cropping
# (sx, sy). Alltoheather: (ox, oy, sx sy).

# This feature is usefull when one wants to extract a region
# of interest from the larger image. In this example we cropped
# the object of interest from the larger image.

# Another fairly advanced option is to resample (upsample or downsample)
# the 2D image immediately after resampling and cropping but before stacking.
# Note the order: first there is reslicing, they you have cropping and
# only after that you have the resampling.
# The resampling is issued with the `--reslice-resampling` switch. Two numbers
# are required which are interpreted as what is the size of the resized images
# with respect to the original image expressed in percents.
# In other words, when you put 50, the image will be downsampled twice.
# If you put 200, the image will be upsampled twice. Of course, you can put
# two different numbers.
